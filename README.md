This is not a website. This is an interactive stain, an experiment in digital grime dedicated to the patron saint of messes, Chookie Mangus. It's a single-page web application that festers with modern JavaScript effects, all crammed into the grimy shell of a broken arcade machine.

The entire nightmare is self-contained. It requires no backend, no database, no sanity. It just... is.

## üí• KEY MESSES üí•

This unholy creation is bubbling with several key features:

#### An Unholy, Screen-Smearing Poop Simulation üí©
A high-performance 2D canvas overlay that runs in front of everything. It simulates disgusting, procedurally-generated poop with disturbingly accurate gravity, smearing its filth down your screen as you try to read. It will not darken your site; it will only defile it.

#### Infinitely Expanding Grime (Automatic Media Loading) ü¶†
The photo and video galleries fester and grow on their own. Shovel new files into the `media/` folder (following a dark ritual of naming them `photo-#` or `video-#`), and the site will automatically find and display them. No code changes needed. The mess is self-propagating.

#### Play 'SNAKE BUT GROSS' üïπÔ∏èü§Æ
A fully playable snake game where you control a custom-rendered head of unspeakable horror. Consume procedurally-drawn poop to grow into an ever-longer, fleshy nightmare. It's exactly as horrible as it sounds.

#### WEAPONIZED CHAOS (The 'PRESS' Button) üí•
Don't press the button. If you do, it will unleash a seizure-inducing barrage of evidence from the photo gallery, flinging the images across the screen with randomized physics. It's a digital tantrum.

#### Festering Arcade Rot (Aesthetic) ü§¢
The entire experience is wrapped in the loving embrace of digital decay. CRT scanlines, flickering neon text, and CSS-powered glitch effects claw at the headers, ensuring no part of the screen feels stable or clean.

## üõ†Ô∏è THE GUTS OF THE MACHINE üõ†Ô∏è

What unholy amalgamation of code powers this nightmare? Only the most readily available, client-side viscera.

*   **Frontend Carcass:**
    *   **HTML5:** The bones of the structure.
    *   **CSS3:** The oozing, pulsating skin, complete with animations and glitch-sores.
    *   **JavaScript (ES6+):** The corrupted soul. It powers the game, the poop simulation, and the automatic festering of content.

*   **Containment Server:**
    *   **Nginx:** A surprisingly robust cage for this much chaos.
    *   **Certbot & Let's Encrypt:** For wrapping the filth in a deceptive layer of HTTPS security.

## üöÄ INFECT YOUR MACHINE üöÄ

If you wish to host this plague on your own machine, follow these steps. You have been warned.

### Prerequisites
You need a local server demon. The script will not work if you just open the `index.html` file like a normal person.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the infection:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/twykex/ChookieMangus.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the festering heart of the project:**
    ```sh
    cd ChookieMangus
    ```

3.  **Create the `images` folder:** This is where the cursor-fly and the grimy background texture live. The repository does not track them, for they are too disgusting.
    ```    /images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fly-cursor.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ placeholder-dirty-carpet.png
    ```

4.  **Summon the local server demon:**
    *If you serve the Python demon:*
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    *Other demons may also work.*

5.  **Behold your mistake:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## üìÅ A MAP OF THE GRIME üìÅ

The repository is structured to hide the worst of the filth. The truly massive media files are ignored by the `.gitignore` ritual to keep the main infection small and agile.

```/

üîÑ HOW TO MAKE THE MESS BIGGER üîÑ
The machine must be fed.
Feed it More Pictures:
Throw your new images (.jpg, .png) into the media/pics/ folder.
Perform the renaming ritual: photo-10.jpg, photo-11.png, etc.
The site will consume them and display them.
Shovel in More Videos:
Throw your new videos (.webm, .mp4) into the media/vids/ folder.
Perform the renaming ritual: video-17.webm, video-18.mp4, etc.
The site will vomit them onto the screen.
üìú THE UNWRITTEN RULES üìú
This project is released under the MIT License. I don't know what that is, but a smart box told me to put it here. Do whatever you want. I don't care. I already broke all the rules anyway.
