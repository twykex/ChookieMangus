This is not a website. This is an interactive stain, an experiment in digital grime dedicated to the patron saint of messes, Chookie Mangus. It is a single-page web application that festers with modern JavaScript effects, all crammed into the grimy shell of a broken arcade machine.

The entire nightmare is self-contained. It requires no backend, no database, no sanity. It just... *is*.

## 💥 Key Features

This unholy creation is bubbling with several key messes:

#### 💩 An Unholy, Screen-Smearing Poop Simulation
A high-performance 2D canvas overlay runs in front of everything. It simulates disgusting, procedurally-generated poop with disturbingly accurate gravity, smearing its filth down your screen as you try to read. It will not darken your site; it will only defile it.

#### 🦠 Infinitely Expanding Grime
The photo and video galleries fester and grow on their own. Shovel new files into the `media/` folder (following a dark ritual of naming them `photo-#` or `video-#`), and the site will automatically find and display them. No code changes are needed. The mess is self-propagating.

#### 🕹️🤮 Play 'SNAKE BUT GROSS'
A fully playable snake game where you control a custom-rendered head of unspeakable horror. Consume procedurally-drawn poop to grow into an ever-longer, fleshy nightmare. It's exactly as horrible as it sounds.

#### 💥 WEAPONIZED CHAOS (The 'PRESS' Button)
Don't press the button. If you do, it will unleash a seizure-inducing barrage of evidence from the photo gallery, flinging the images across the screen with randomized physics. It's a digital tantrum.

#### 🤢 Festering Arcade Rot
The entire experience is wrapped in the loving embrace of digital decay. CRT scanlines, flickering neon text, and CSS-powered glitch effects claw at the headers, ensuring no part of the screen feels stable or clean.

## 🛠️ The Guts of the Machine

What unholy amalgamation of code powers this nightmare? Only the most readily available, client-side viscera.

*   **Frontend Carcass:**
    *   **HTML5:** The bones of the structure.
    *   **CSS3:** The oozing, pulsating skin, complete with animations and glitch-sores.
    *   **JavaScript (ES6+):** The corrupted soul that powers the game, the poop simulation, and the automatic festering of content.

*   **Containment Server:**
    *   **Nginx:** A surprisingly robust cage for this much chaos.
    *   **Certbot & Let's Encrypt:** For wrapping the filth in a deceptive layer of HTTPS security.

## 🚀 Infect Your Machine

If you wish to host this plague on your own machine, follow these steps. You have been warned.

### Prerequisites

You need a local server demon. The script will **not** work if you just open the `index.html` file in a browser like a normal person.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the infection:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/twykex/ChookieMangus.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the festering heart of the project:**
    ```sh
    cd ChookieMangus
    ```

3.  **Create the `images` folder:** This is where the cursor-fly and the grimy background texture live. The repository does not track them, for they are too disgusting.
    ```
    /images/
    ├── fly-cursor.png
    └── placeholder-dirty-carpet.png
    ```

4.  **Summon a local server demon:**
    *If using the Python demon:*
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    *Other demons may also work.*

5.  **Behold your mistake:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 📁 A Map of the Grime

The repository is structured to hide the worst of the filth. The truly massive media files are ignored by the `.gitignore` ritual to keep the main infection small and agile.

## 🔄 How to Make the Mess Bigger

The machine must be fed.

### Feed it More Pictures:

1.  Throw your new images (`.jpg`, `.png`) into the `media/pics/` folder.
2.  Perform the renaming ritual: `photo-10.jpg`, `photo-11.png`, etc.
3.  The site will consume them and display them.

### Shovel in More Videos:

1.  Throw your new videos (`.webm`, `.mp4`) into the `media/vids/` folder.
2.  Perform the renaming ritual: `video-17.webm`, `video-18.mp4`, etc.
3.  The site will vomit them onto the screen.

This project is released under the **MIT License**. I don't know what that is, but a smart box told me to put it here. Do whatever you want. I don't care. I already broke all the rules anyway.
